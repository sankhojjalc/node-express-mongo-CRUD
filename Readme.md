==This Repo is a boiler plate for any NodeJS application. ==
I have initialized the boiler plate with basic CRUD operations.

Tasks involved here in this repo:

- [x] Implement basic CRUD operations with pure Node and Express JS
- [x] Connect with MongoDB
- [ ] Convert the code according to industry standard folder structures.
- [ ] Implement only login users can only modify the TODO list, else user can only view TODOs
- [ ] Add complex logic of aggregation pipelines, etc.

// Apart from the folder structure, you can install Prettier package.
// It should be installed as DEV dependency.
// Add .prettierrc AND .prettierignore
